# Dummy App

Dummy Rails application to test the `Maily` engine.

Run the suite (from `Maily` root path):

```
> bundle exec rake
```

It's also used as a demo application to show `Maily` in action and for development purposes. You can run the app locally by using the following command:

```
> bundle exec rake web
```
